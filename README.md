# Flare_spec_ana

Using "spec_param_ext_1sigma.csh", you can extract a spectral fitting value and error from .log file of Xspec.
In this program, the model was set to just one "apec" (thin-thermal plasma model).
If the value was not determine (upper limit, lower limit or non-derived), "NaN" is assigned to its column.
You should specified just .log file as a variable of ${1}.
Please see the script for detail.

This program is still developing.
